      <p class="body-text serif">Critics and pundits have been alleging the Republican Party of making the United States Judicial System conservative.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">An analysis of data on the United States Courts website shows that it is not true. Democrats appointed a higher number of judges to the U.S. district courts than Republicans since 1989 when George Bush was elected president.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Data shows that the number of judges appointed to district courts by President Donald Trump is lesser than judges appointed by former President Barack Obama in equal time periods. In fact, Donald Trump put the second least number of judges on the Supreme Court during his time in office since 1989.</p>

      <h3 class="section-head serif">Judge appointments to U.S. Court of Appeals</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif"> Although Trump didn't send more judges to the district courts, he did send the highest number of judges to Court of Appeals. Experts say having more conservative judges than democratic judges will have a greater impact on the U.S. judicial system. Court of Appeals has powers in terms of making changes to the laws of the land and has the power to overturn judgments by district courts.</p>
